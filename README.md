# Notes

- conf and tests directories were created manually following along with the Youtube tutorial
- spec and support directories were created following along with this tutorial: https://jasmine.github.io/2.3/node.html#section-Configuration; note: it currently does not point to the test in my `tests` directory - the spec file naming is different
- to add nicer console output, I installed jasmine-console-reporter based on the third answer on this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7157999/output-jasmine-test-results-to-the-console
- TODO: as of March 21, not seeing verbose logs following those steps. Where to call jasmine.callReporter() or whatever

Jasmine console reporter node package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-console-reporter
Github repo, not much more info except for pretty screenshots: https://github.com/onury/jasmine-console-reporter
